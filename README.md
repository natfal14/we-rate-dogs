# we-rate-dogs
This was a project for the Udacity data analysis nanodegree.
The goal of this project was to test my data analysis skills by going through the process of gathering, assessing and cleaning data. The data used was the tweet history of the WeRateDogs Twitter account obtained by using the Twitter API to get the JSON file. I then cleaned 2 other given datasets that had information about each tweet including the type of dog in each tweet's picture, their name and the nickname used for each. Finally, I used graphs to visualize the data for easier analysis.
